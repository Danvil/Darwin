* water

* use photon mapping for GI (save photons in cubes) 
* user defined cube type and appearance properties (with a template?)
* transparent cubes for GI
* better lighting randomness / remove artifacts
* Cube size should be variable (at least n or 2^n cubes per meter)
* add option to switch between infinite world and fixed size world
  - auto cell generation
  - cell storage
* put all code into the namespace 'Cubes'
* create easy to use interface class
